# Pygame-Multiplayer-Framework

This is a multiplayer framework designed to help get you started building an online game with python and pygame. The framework currently has the ability to connect to players to the same game via a server. The players can both see each other moving around and jumping.

To run the code for yourself simpily download the server and client code. Run the server and 2 instances of the client and you should see that each client can see the other moving around :D

Thank You!
